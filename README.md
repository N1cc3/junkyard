## Story

The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic world. Your only refuge in the harsh
world is a rusty shed you call your home. Even though it is not much, you
desperately want to protect it from the very aggressive robots that are crawling
all over the place!


## How to play

You play the game by collecting junk, from which you can build turrets that can
shoot down the robots. Unfortunately, there is only one type of turret
implemented. The turret takes five cubes to build. If the robots get too close
to you, you will automatically lose the game. When that happens, there is a five
second delay, and the game will automatically restart.

Pick up objects with the right mouse button when close enough, and place them
with the left.
With the scroll wheel you change active placement slot.
Jump with space, and if you for some reason have an urge to walk instead
of running, you can do that with shift.
